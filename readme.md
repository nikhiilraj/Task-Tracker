## 🎯 Why I Built This
- To understand **Node.js fundamentals** and its runtime  
- To learn how to work with **file systems (fs)** and **JSON data persistence**  
- To practice **modular code structure** and separation of concerns  
- To get comfortable with **command-line argument handling**

## Key Learnings

- learned to manage state persistence without DB
- practiced modular coding instead of writing everything in one file
- understood how to structure small CLI projects
- improved confidence in moving from theory → working software
